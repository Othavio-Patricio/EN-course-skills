## JavaScript Libraries and CSS Frameworks

Here, I learned how to add JavaScript and CSS libraries to my sites.<br>
There are literally thousands of JavaScript and CSS libraries freely available on the Internet, with the most diverse purposes. As the sites I develop become more complex, I will need to find and integrate tools that facilitate and accelerate development.

I am now able to:
- [x] Add and use JavaScript and CSS libraries on your sites.
- [x] Use external JavaScript libraries from a CDN.
