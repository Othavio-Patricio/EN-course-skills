## Internet - Understanding how it works

Here I had a general understanding of the ecosystem in which I will work, making me able to talk on an equal footing with other developers about my work.<br>
Here I also did my first HTML test.

#### I am now able to:
- [x] Explain in a simple way how the internet works.
- [x] Understand the Client & Server model and identify its parts.
- [x] Understand how HTTP and HTTPS protocols work.
- [x] Identify which types of requests can be made through these protocols.
