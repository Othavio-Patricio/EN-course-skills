## HTML & CSS - Selectors and Placement

Here I learned in practice how to change the page layout using CSS, as well as use well-defined selection rules to choose exactly the type of element I want to style.

I am now able to:
- [x] Understand how the CSS Box Model works and how page elements visually relate to each other.
- [x] Position elements on the page in different ways.
- [x] Combine and group CSS selectors to create well-defined rules.
