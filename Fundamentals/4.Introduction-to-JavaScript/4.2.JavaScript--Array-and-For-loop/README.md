## JavaScript - Array and For loop

In this second part about JavaScript, I learned two of the main data structures available in the language and some ways to iterate over them.
I advanced my knowledge and understood more about Array and For.

I am now able to:
- [x] Manipulate arrays (lists);
- [x] Use the for command;
