## Introduction to JavaScript and Programming Logic

Here I learned about the JavaScript programming language.<br>
For this, the content was divided into five parts:

First I learned about variables, constants, primitive types, dynamic typing, arithmetic operators, assignment operators, logical operators, if/else and switch/case.<br>
Then arrays and for.<br>
In the third part I learned about programming logic and algorithms.<br>
The fourth part covers objects, for/in and functions.<br>
And the Playground Functions project (Lessons Learned).
