## JavaScript ES6 - Higher Order Functions - map and filter

Here I learned about two other Higher Order Functions: Array.map and Array.filter
The map function is perhaps one of the most powerful (and complex!) functions for manipulating and creating arrays. Together, these HOFs will make your code more readable, concise, and expressive.

I am now able to:
- [x] Use the Array.map function to manipulate and build arrays;
- [x] Use the Array.filter function to filter an array;
- [x] Learn to use Higher Order Functions together.
