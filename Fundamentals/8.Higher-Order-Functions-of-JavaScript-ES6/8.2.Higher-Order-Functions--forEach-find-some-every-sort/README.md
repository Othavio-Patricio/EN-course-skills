## JavaScript ES6 - Higher Order Functions - forEach, find, some, every, sort

Here I met some HOFs that are used with arrays. These functions are quite powerful, and can greatly facilitate the manipulation and creation of arrays, resulting in a more readable, concise and expressive code.

Now I am able to:
- [x] Use the Array.forEach function to iterate over all the elements of an array;
- [x] Use the Array.find function to find the first element of an array that satisfies a condition;
- [x] Use the Array.some and Array.every functions to test whether the elements of an array satisfy a condition;
- [x] Use the Array.sort function to sort arrays according to some criteria.
