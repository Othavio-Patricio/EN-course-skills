## Introduction to HTML and CSS


First I learned to use the main HTML tags to create the structure of web pages.<br>
Then I learned how to use CSS to style the tags, using different ways to select HTML elements.<br>
Here I also learned how to change the placement of elements on the page and how some specific properties change the dimensions of elements.<br>
In the last piece of content, I learned about the meaning that each HTML element carries and how it impacts page accessibility and the interpretation of content by search indexers such as Google.<br>
Finally, I developed my own page, applying all my knowledge, according to the specification of the final project.
