## JavaScript - Programming Logic and Algorithms

Here I learned about algorithms and programming logic, the basis of everything I will do from now on.<br>
To create an algorithm, I had to develop an analytical ability to turn large problems into small, chained logical commands. I developed this way of reasoning with programming logic.

I am now able to:
- [x] Break big problems into small ones;
- [x] Use programming logic to solve problems.
