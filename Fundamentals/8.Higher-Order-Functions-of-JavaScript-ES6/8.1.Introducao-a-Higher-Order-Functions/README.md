## Introduction to Higher Order Functions

Here, I learned the concepts and applications of the so-called Higher Order Functions, as well as understanding how we can benefit from this valuable resource when building code.<br>
These functions are quite powerful, and we can use them to implement solutions for different types of situations. Resulting in a more readable, concise and expressive code.

I am now able to:
- [x] Use functions in different ways;
- [x] Reuse code logic;
- [x] Apply the concept of Higher Order Functions.
