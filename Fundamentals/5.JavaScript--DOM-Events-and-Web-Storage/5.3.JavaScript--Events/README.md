## JavaScript - Events

Here I learned how to use JavaScript events to make functions run when someone uses them or when the browser interacts with my web page.

I am now able to:
- [x] Change the content, style and other attributes of HTML elements from JavaScript events.
- [x] Apply click and change events, among others, in your JavaScript code.
