## Understanding the commands

Here I learned the concept of git clone, git pull and branch creations and also some techniques to maximize the efficiency of this group work, ensuring a good quality of the software I write.

#### I am now able to:

[x]Copy an existing repository on GitHub to your computer
[x]Open Pull Requests
[x]Work on the same project, with more than one person, in an asynchronous and distributed way
