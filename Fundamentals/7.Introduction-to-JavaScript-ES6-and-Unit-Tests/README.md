## Introduction to JavaScript ES6 and Unit Tests

Here, I learned about the newest version of JavaScript known as ES6, ECMAScript 6 or ES2015.<br>
These various names may raise some doubt, but in fact they all refer to the same language. JavaScript is what we call the language, only that name is an Oracle trademark. The official name of the language is ECMAScript, and ES is just the abbreviation (ECMAScript).<br>
This new version has some goals:
- [x] Be a better language for building complex applications;
- [x] Resolve old JavaScript issues;
- [x] Facilitate the development of libraries.
