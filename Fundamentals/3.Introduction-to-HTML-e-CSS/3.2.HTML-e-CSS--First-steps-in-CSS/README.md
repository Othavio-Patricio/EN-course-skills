## HTML & CSS - Getting Started with CSS

Here I learned in practice how to use CSS to make my pages more beautiful.

I am now able to:
- [x] Create style rules for HTML tags using CSS.
- [x] Use tag, id and class selectors to apply CSS rules.
- [x] Change font and color characteristics of web pages.
- [x] Use inline and external CSS.
