## Front End Development

In this module, I learned how to use React so that, from the layout of a web application, I can develop it completely: with CSS, tests and state management.

I am now able to:
- [x] Use the React library to create Front-end applications that connect with APIs.
- [x] Create web interfaces with navigation routes using React Router.
- [x] Work as a team using the SCRUM methodology.
- [x] Test applications using React Testing Library (RTL).
- [x] Manage all state of React applications using Redux.
