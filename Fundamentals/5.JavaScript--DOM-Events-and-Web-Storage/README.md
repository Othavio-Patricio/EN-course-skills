## JavaScript: DOM, Events and Web Storage

Here I learned about the famous DOM, the structure that bridges HTML and JavaScript and allows interaction between the two. Finally, I learned a little about some possible interactions: how to retrieve data from HTML through JavaScript.

I am now able to:
- [x] Access HTML data with JavaScript through DOM selectors.
- [x] Add and remove HTML elements from the page via JavaScript.
- [x] Fetch page elements with parentNode property.
- [x] Change the content, style and other attributes of HTML elements from JavaScript events.
- [x] Apply click and change events, among others, in your JavaScript code.
- [x] Manipulate the localStorage object;
- [x] Manipulate the sessionStorage object.
