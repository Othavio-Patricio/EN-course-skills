## JavaScript - First steps

Here I learned to implement logic in my pages, making them truly interactive and dynamic!

I learned:
- [x] What is JavaScript (JS)?
- [x] Where did it come from?
- [x] What is your use?
- [x] Variables.
- [x] Constants.
- [x] Primitive types.
- [x] Dynamic typing.
- [x] Arithmetic operators.
- [x] Assignment operators.
- [x] Logical operators.
- [x] Conditional structures like if/else and switch/case.

I am now able to:
- [x] Write JavaScript code that uses variables, constants and primitive types.
- [x] Use language concepts such as dynamic typing and logical/arithmetic/assignment operators in your code.
- [x] Create code that uses conditional structures, like if/else.
