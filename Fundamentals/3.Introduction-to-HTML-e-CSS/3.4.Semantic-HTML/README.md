## Semantic HTML

Here I learned the meaning that an HTML element carries about its content is called Semantic HTML.

I am now able to:
- [x] Make use of HTML elements according to the meaning and purpose they carry. Such elements include, but are not limited to: header, nav, aside, article, section, footer and img ;
- [x] Create semantically valid and accessible pages;
- [x] Understand the difference between block elements and inline elements.
