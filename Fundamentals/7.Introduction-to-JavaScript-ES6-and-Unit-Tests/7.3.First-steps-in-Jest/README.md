## Getting Started in Jest

Here, I learned about unit testing and also how to test in small steps.<br>
The concept of testing in small steps, on the other hand, talks about how to guide our development based on the tests!<br>
For this, I will use Jest, a JavaScript testing framework developed by Facebook.

I am now able to:
- [x] Understand what unit tests are and what they are for;
- [x] Apply the concept of TDD, that is, test-oriented development;
- [x] Create unit tests from the Jest framework.
