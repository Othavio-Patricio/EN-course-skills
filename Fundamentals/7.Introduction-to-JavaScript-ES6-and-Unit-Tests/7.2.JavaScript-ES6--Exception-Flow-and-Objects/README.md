## JavaScript ES6 - Exception Flow and Objects

Here, I learned a little about exception flow! That is, how to handle errors in your code using the throw and try/catch methods. Also, I saw some functions that interact with objects. These methods will help you a lot when you need some reading of your values ​​or keys, or when you need to copy them. This is a very important step towards the good and more advanced use of JavaScript. Objects are very present in all ES6 logic.

I am now able to:
- [x] Throw errors and catch them with the try/catch block;
- [x] Access all the keys of an object with the Object.keys method;
- [x] Access the key-value pairs of an object with the Object.entries method;
- [x] Access all values ​​of an object with the Object.values ​​method;
- [x] Copy an object with the Object.assign method;
- [x] Add properties to an object.
