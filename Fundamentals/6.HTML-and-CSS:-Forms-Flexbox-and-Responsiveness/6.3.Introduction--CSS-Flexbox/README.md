## Introduction - CSS Flexbox

Here I learned about CSS Flexbox.<br>
Developing responsive web pages is a very important task as people access the Internet through various devices with different screen sizes.<br>
One of the approaches to creating responsive pages is to divide the page into logical segments, using percentage-based calculations, and then adjusting the elements to fit that defined space.<br>
Unfortunately, the practice is not as simple as described above. This is because elements don't by default sit next to each other as we'd like - at least not the ones that have the display property set to block. Another common problem is, after everything is configured, adding margins and defining the float property again misconfigures the entire structure initially proposed.<br>
As described above, creating responsive pages using float and positioning is a tricky job.<br>
To make this job easier, I learned to use CSS Flexbox, which is a layout module that makes it easy to develop responsive frameworks.<br>
For this, the content was divided into two parts:

1. First I learned about the flex-direction, flex-wrap, flex-flow, reverse, justify-content, align-items and align-content properties. All these properties will be applied in containers.


2. Now you will learn about align-self, order, flex-grow, flex-shrink and flex-basis properties. We will also see how we can work with margins in Flexbox. These properties will be applied to items.
