## Asynchronous JavaScript - Fetch API and async/await

Callbacks are used everywhere in JavaScript. Depending on the complexity of what you want to do, however, callbacks can very quickly get confusing and not very readable. To make the code more understandable, I studied asynchronous JavaScript in today's class. And, with that asynchronism, I made a small web page that collects data from a third-party service using their API.

I am now able to:
- [x] Use then() and catch();
- [x] Use async/await together with try/catch;
- [x] Make integrations with third-party APIs.
